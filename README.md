# Rubiks Cube visualisation

A rubiks cube rendering built using the OpenFrameworks toolkit for C++.
I hope to eventually include a randomiser, move parser and solver, as well as the ability to render larger cubes. 

## Done 
Cube rendering and basic face rotation 

## Todo
* Complete face rotations
* Rotation animation
* Ability to parse cube notation
* CFOP based solver
* Abstaction for bigger NxN cubes
